# FaceGeneration From Textual Description
Text-to-face generation is a subfield of computer graphics and machine learning that aims to
generate realistic images of human faces from text descriptions.The ability for face recognition
generation to aid in crucial activities, such reconstruction of criminal face , is what motivated
us to do this work, and the need to enhance the image quality and semantic alignment. This can
be accomplished through a variety of techniques, such as deep learning and generative mod-
els. Three models—DFGAN, SAGAN, and DFGAN—are the subject of this study’s comparative
investigation.
